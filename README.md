# JavaScript_Clock

Part 2 of Wes Bos JavaScript30 course

I learned about Date(); method for retriving time and how to use that along with setInterval() to set and update time for a virtual clock. 
I learned about CSS transform and transition uses in order to create animations. transition-timing-function was especially eye opening as
it can create neat effects.
