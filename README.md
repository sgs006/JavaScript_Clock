## General info

New Things I Learned: 

1)Learned about Date(); method for retriving time and how to use that along with setInterval() to set and update time for a virtual clock. [MDN Date()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date), [w3schools setInterval()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp)

2) I learned about CSS transform and transition uses in order to create animations. Transition-timing-function was especially eye opening as it can create neat effects. [MDN CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions)
